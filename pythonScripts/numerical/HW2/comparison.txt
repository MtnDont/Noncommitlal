1a:
The output of Gaussian Elimination with and without partial pivoting of the matrices
A = [ 3  1  4  -1;
      2 -2 -1   2;
      5  7  14 -8;
      1  3   2  4 ]
b = [ 7 1 20 -4 ]^T
is shown to be much different from each other, where the output of the Gaussian Elimination
without partial pivoting cannot find a solution as shown by the output:

[nan nan nan 1.]

where the output of the Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting provides an approximate
solution:

[ 1. -1.  1. -1.]
