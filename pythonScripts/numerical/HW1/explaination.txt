The issue displayed in output3.txt is that a solution set does not exist for the matrix
x + 2y + 3z = -5
4x + 5y + 6z = 3
7x + 8y + 9z = 11

A = 1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9
b = -5
    3
    11
Calculating the determinate of the matrix A shows that it equals 0 as shown below:
det(A) = 1(5*9 - 6*7) - 2(4*9 - 6*8) + 3(4*8 - 5*7) = 0

Theory tells you that Ax = b has a unique solution if det(A) != 0 and otherwise it has no
solution or infinitely many.

Through the 3rd iteration of the matrix in the gauss_elim(A, b) function, the matrix 
contains a zero row that equals 8. 0 != 8, therefore the matrix has no solution for
Ax = b. Issues are thrown during the back_sub(Ab, n) when division is being used on the zero
row as a number cannot be divided by 0 further supporting that the matrix has no solution
for Ax = b.
